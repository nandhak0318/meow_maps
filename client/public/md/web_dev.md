It's basically where you decide the base/structure of a website

## CSS


> It's like the 'muscle' of a website


build upon the 'skeleton'(html) which decide how the site looks


all the pretty buttons and styles are form here

> It's the 'brain' which can control the 'muscle'(css) and 'skeleton'(html)

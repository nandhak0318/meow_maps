# Hello
Came to learn programming huh..


you may have heared lot of things like programming is hard and blah blah blah.
it's NOT.

Programming is easier than a random thing make you zone out.

so let's begin


## What is a programming language?
there's a lot of typical defeniton..


in my words
Programming is nothing different that speaking to a person.


you are going to tell the computer what to do in a way that it can understand and it will do for you. that's all the programming is.

### We're talking to a computer

like we have choices like tamil, english, malayalam to talk to someother person

for talking to computers we have c, cpp, python..ect...

## How to choose one
There are tons of languages out there what language should i learn???

A common question..

It's based on what you going to do..

like rn if you want to flirt with a girl you don't choose tamil much right..
it'll be like "ne ok sonna un kaaladi nai selvi kaaladi naai"

I mean we can flirt in tamil. but we don't prefer it right.

just like that we can use any programming language for anything but we choose the most comfortable one.

## LOGIC
The most important thing

Let's see an example

#### Hello world program in python

print('hello world')

OUTPUT: hello world

#### Hello world program in java

class Main{
  public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println('hello world');
  }
}

OUTPUT: hello world

### The output is same
As you can see no matter which language or how long the program is the output is same.

it's about the logic
you can learn a programming language syntax in few hours..

but logic building comes from practice..

for example i told you to build a calcualtor:

your mind will be like

*variable is a place we store things like numbers, names (strings)*

okay let's take input on two variables

lets add that up and store in a third variable

print the output

you can write this logic in any language right..

like tell to computer you want to do this in any language right

### It's about what you're going to tell

## Alright
let's start coding..



we'll go with python (becuase that's the easy thing. you can start with anything you want)

then we try some problems and learn how to build logics

then we move on to web dev..
